### Child Abuse Data Analysis using Power BI

This project is focused on analyzing child abuse data to identify trends, patterns, and key metrics related to child care, legal support, and perpetrator demographics across various states. The goal is to provide insights into child protection efforts, care provider availability, and the distribution of child abuse cases using Power BI’s interactive and dynamic data visualization tools.

Key visualizations and analyses in the project include:

- **Top 5 States with Child Care Providers**: A column chart is created to display the top five states with the highest number of child care providers, helping to understand regional support availability for child care.
  
- **Top States with Highest Child Legal Guidance**: A doughnut chart highlights the states with the most extensive legal guidance available for child abuse victims. This helps in identifying the areas with strong legal infrastructure for child protection.
  
- **Top 5 Perpetrators by State**: A funnel chart is used to show the top five states with the highest number of perpetrators involved in child abuse cases. This chart allows stakeholders to focus on regions with the most significant need for intervention.

- **Top 6 States with Highest Number of Parents**: Another column chart showcases the six states with the most parents involved in child care, both fostering and otherwise, indicating regions with high parental engagement in child protection.

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Power BI cards are used to display key metrics, such as:
  - Total number of parents.
  - Total number of states in the dataset.
  - Top perpetrator state.
  - Total number of unmarried and foster parents.
  - Total number of child day care providers.
  - Total multiple relationships recorded.

The analysis provides a comprehensive view of the child care and abuse landscape across different regions, enabling policymakers, researchers, and child welfare organizations to make data-driven decisions. By visualizing critical data points, this project aims to assist in prioritizing resources, improving child protection services, and developing targeted strategies for reducing child abuse.
